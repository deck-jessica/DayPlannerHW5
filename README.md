# DayPlannerHW5

## Day Planner for the busiest coder

This project was undertaken to develop and deploy an hourly planner and task manager. Key highlights in the functionality of this application: past, present and future tasks are highlighted accordingly; tasks can be saved locally to user's computer; tasks will persist if you accidentally refresh the page; current day and time will be displayed at the top of the page; users can save any task they want in simple hour time slots.

This web applicaton is also styled to be responsive to given screen size. This provides accessibility from mobile devices.

## Usage 

This page can be accessed and used to track the user's daily activities, as well as highlight the current time and task that should be worked on! Upon loading the web application, the current day and time are shown at the top, and dependent upon the time of entry, past tasks/hour blocks will be shown in gray, present tasks shown in red, and future tasks shown in green. Upon entering a task, it will be stored to the page, and persist upon refresh. Users can input their own tasks and see them planned out in hour chunks of time, and not lose their work if they navigate away. Upon each refresh, the time will update.

## Credits

I used my Bootcamp course materials, and some minor help from my classmates and LAs. I also went through Stack Overflow examples, used Bootstrap hacks for the layout, and found some assistance during the last minute hours before the project was due from some amazing LAs within the BootCamp.
