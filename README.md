# DayPlannerHW5

## Day Planner for the busiest coder

This project was undertaken to develop and deploy an hourly planner and task manager. Key highlights in the functionality of this application: past, present and future tasks are highlighted accordingly; tasks can be saved locally to user's computer; tasks will persist if you accidentally refresh the page; current day and time will be displayed at the top of the page; users can save any task they want in simple hour time slots.

This web applicaton is also styled to be responsive to given screen size. This provides accessibility from mobile devices.

## Usage 

This page can be accessed and used to "quiz your knowledge' on Javascript basics. Upon entering the site, you will be given a Start button. Once this is clicked, thanks to an eventListener, the timer function will begin and the quiz questions will display one at a time. The quiz length of the timer is 20 seconds per question on the quiz. Once the timer starts, user will use select an answer. If they have selected correctly, the next question will render, and a "right" will display at the bottom of the question box. If they select wrong, 10 seconds will be deducted from the time left, and "wrong" will display at the bottom of the quiz. The quiz will continue until the questions have been exhausted or time runs out. At the conclusion of the quiz, the user will be prompted to enter their name to be stored in the high score section. Their score is a compliation of the correct answers from the quiz.

## Credits

I used my Bootcamp course materials, and some minor help from my classmates and LAs. I also relied on some Youtube videos for ideas on how to set up the random functions and timers, and found some assistance during the last minute hours before the project was due from some amazing LAs within the BootCamp.
